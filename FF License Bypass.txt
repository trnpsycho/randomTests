Edit host file to include the following line

127.0.0.1	checkip.dyndns.com


Create a new file in the directory c:/web called default.htm.
In this file place the following line of code: 
	<html><head><title>Current IP Check</title></head><body>My Current IP Address: 68.70.67.139</body></html>
Save the file.

Open IIS manager.
Expand Default Web Site, but do NOT drill down to ffnet.
While Default Web Site is highlighted, double click IIS/Authentication
Set Anonymous Authentication to Enabled.

NOW click ffnet, and IIS/Authentication. If Anonymous Authentication got enabled here, turn it back off. (It usually will pickup whatever is in the default which is why we have to turn it back off.)
Click back on Default Web Site.
Restart the website. (On the right hand side of the screen you'll see the Restart under Manage Website.)


Test to make sure when you go to the address http://checkip.dyndns.com/, your browser returns the following string:
	My Current IP Address: 68.70.67.139 <-- The MY at the beginning is what you're looking for. If the My is missing, you did something wrong.

If the test worked, you should be good to go. Treat this as a top secret hack. Please don't let a bunch of people know how this is done, as I've already been warned about passing this data on.
